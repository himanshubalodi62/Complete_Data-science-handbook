It says that within -1 to 1st standard deviation you would be having 68% of data and from -2 to +2 standard deviation you hold 95% of data and last but not least from -3 to +3 you hold 99.7% of data.

To handle high variance you can go for multiple final models instead of one or do early stopping at the time of training.\n",
